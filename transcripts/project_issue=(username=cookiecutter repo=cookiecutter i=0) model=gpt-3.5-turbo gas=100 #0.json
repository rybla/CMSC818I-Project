      "content": "The following are the top question that matched the query, along with their accepted answers. \n\n# Question 1\n\n## Problem Statement\nI have Sage 4.7.1 installed and have run into an odd problem.  Many of my older scripts that use functions like deepcopy() and uniq() no longer recognize them as global names.  I have been able to fix this by importing the python modules one by one, but this is quite tedious.  But when I start the command-line Sage interface, I can type \"list2=deepcopy(list1)\" without importing the copy module, and this works fine.  How is it possible that the command line Sage can recognize global name 'deepcopy' but if I load my script that uses the same name it doesn't recognize it?\r\n\r\noops, sorry, not familiar with stackoverflow yet. I type: 'sage_4.7.1/sage\" to start the command line interface; then, I type \"load jbom.py\" to load up all the functions I defined in a python script. When I use one of the functions from the script, it runs for a few seconds (complex function) then hits a spot where I use some function that Sage normally has as a global name (deepcopy, uniq, etc) but for some reason the script I loaded does not know what the function is.  And to reiterate, my script jbom.py used to work the last time I was working on this particular research, just as I described.\r\n\r\nIt also makes no difference if I use 'load jbom.py' or 'import jbom'.  Both methods get the functions I defined in my script (but I have to use jbom.<fcuntion_name> in the second case) and both get the same error about 'deepcopy' not being a global name.\r\n\r\nREPLY TO DSM: I have been sloppy about describing the problem, for which I am sorry.  I have created a new script 'experiment.py' that has \"import jbom\" as its first line.  Executing the function in experiment.py recognizes the functions in jbom.py but deepcopy is not recognized.  I tried loading jbom.py as \"load jbom.py\" and I can use the functions just like I did months ago.  So, is this all just a problem of layering scripts without proper usage of import/load etc?\r\n\r\nSOLVED: I added \"from sage.all import *\" to the beginning of jbom.py and now I can load experiment.py and execute the functions calling jbom.py functions without any problems.  From the Sage doc on import/load I can't really tell what I was doing wrong exactly.\n\n## Solution\nOkay, here's what's going on:\r\n\r\nYou can only `import` files ending with `.py` (ignoring `.py[co]`)  These are standard Python files and aren't preparsed, so `1/3 == int(0)`, not `QQ(1)/QQ(3)`, and you don't have the equivalent of a `from sage.all import *` to play with.\r\n\r\nYou can `load` and `attach` both `.py` and `.sage` files (as well as `.pyx` and `.spyx` and `.m`).  Both have access to Sage definitions but the `.py` files aren't preparsed (so `y=17` makes `y` a Python `int`) while the `.sage` files are (so `y=17` makes `y` a Sage `Integer`).\r\n\r\nSo `import jbom` here works just like it would in Python, and you don't get the access to what Sage has put in scope.  `load` etc. are handy but they don't scale up to larger programs so well.  I've proposed improving this in the past and making `.sage` scripts less second-class citizens, but there hasn't yet been the mix of agreement on what to do and energy to do it.  In the meantime your best bet is to import from `sage.all`.",
