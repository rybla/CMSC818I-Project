The code involves a long for-loop, but for debugging purposes, I don't need to iterate through the whole thing. Instead, I'd like to break out after a few iterations. I'm trying to figure out how to do so without modifying my code to have special debugging instructions. \r\n\r\nExample for loop \r\n\r\n```py\r\nindices = range(10000, 0, -1)\r\nfor i, val in enumerate(indices):\r\n     print(val) # I can tell that it's working after a few iterations\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first thing I tried was typing `break` in the debugging console when paused at the `print(val)` line. This resulted in a syntax error \r\n\r\n> SyntaxError: 'break' outside loop\r\n\r\nI also thought about using the debugging console line to modify the variable that I am enumerating over. For example, entering\r\n\r\n```py\r\nindices = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has no effect on the iterator. Apparently, the iterator has an independent copy of the variable. \r\n\r\nIn another language, Java for example, I would take advantage of the termination condition, but python loops don't have a termination condition. I could rewrite my for-loop as a while-loop so that it would have an explicit termination condition, but that would obfuscate the code. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be to add special debugging instructions. For example,\r\n\r\n```py\r\nmode = 'debug'\r\nindices = range(10000, 0, -1)\r\nfor i, val in enumerate(indices):\r\n     print(val) # I can tell that it's working after a few iterations\r\n     if mode == 'debug' and i % 10:\r\n         break\r\n```\r\n\r\nI dislike doing this because inevitably, one of these special instructions gets left in after debugging is finished and mucks everything up. \r\n\r\nDo I have any other options to break out of the loop from the debug console or without modifying the code?\r\n\n\n## Solution\n> I dislike doing this because inevitably, one of these special instructions gets left in after debugging is finished and mucks everything up.\r\n\r\nPython `for` loops just aren't designed to be [changed during execution][1], besides hard coding `break`, `return` or throwing `StopIteration`. (You are debugging, so either change the range in the loops expression list, or let it run through). The reason being the advantages of straightforward simplicity outweigh exposing the `for` loop counter - see [PEP 212][2].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement\r\n  [2]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0212/#introduction", "tool_call_id": "call_ggI5BANr9b20ZTWNW0k9BpMW"}}, {"_tag": "AppendMainMessage", "msg": {"role": "user", "content": "Given this new additional context, now respond with one of the following:\n    - if you now think the potential bug is probably NOT a bug, then respond with: \"NO BUG\"\n    - if you STILL think the potential bug probably IS a bug, then respond with \"YES BUG\" followed up an updated description of the potential bug\n    \n    You MUST repond with exactly one of those options.", "tool_call_id": "None"}}, {"_tag": "NextMainMessage"}, {"_tag": "AppendMainMessage", "msg": {"role": "assistant", "content": "YES BUG \n\nUpdated Description:\nThe loop in 'src/black/comments.py' does not have a termination condition, potentially causing an infinite loop.
