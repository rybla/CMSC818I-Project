      "content": "The following are the top question that matched the query, along with their accepted answers. \n\n    # Question 1\n\n    ## Problem Statement\n    I have a function in python that can either return a `bool` or a `list`. Is there a way to specify the return types using type hints?\n\nFor example, is this the correct way to do it?\n\n    def foo(id) -> list or bool:\n        ...\n\n    ## Solution\n    From the documentation - [Union Type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-union):\r\n\r\n> A union object holds the value of the `|` (bitwise or) operation on multiple [type objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-type-objects). These types are intended primarily for [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-annotation). The union type expression enables cleaner type hinting syntax compared to [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union).\r\n\r\nThis use of `|` was added in Python 3.10. Hence the proper way to represent more than one return data type is:\r\n\r\n    def foo(client_id: str) -> list | bool:\r\n\r\nFor earlier versions, use [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union):\r\n\r\n    from typing import Union\r\n    \r\n\r\n    def foo(client_id: str) -> Union[list, bool]:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBut do note that typing is not enforced.  Python continues to remain a dynamically-typed language.  The annotation syntax has been developed to help during the development of the code prior to being released into production.  As [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) states, \"no type checking happens at runtime.\"\r\n\r\n    >>> def foo(a: str) -> list:\r\n    ...     return \"Works\"\r\n    ... \r\n    >>> foo(1)\r\n    'Works'\r\n\r\nAs you can see I am passing an int value and returning a str. However the `__annotations__` will be set to the respective values. \r\n\r\n    >>> foo.__annotations__ \r\n    {'return': <class 'list'>, 'a': <class 'str'>}\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPlease go through [PEP 483](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/) for more about Type hints. Also see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32557920/what-are-type-hints-in-python-3-5?\r\n\r\nKindly note that this is available only for ***Python 3.5*** and upwards. This is mentioned clearly in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).",
