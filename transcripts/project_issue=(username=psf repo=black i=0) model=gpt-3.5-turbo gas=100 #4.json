These flags are used by multiple functions. The values of the flags are set by optional command line arguments which I parse using `argparse`.\r\n\r\nAt present I have these flags in global scope outside of any of the functions that use the flags rather than have the flags passed as arguments to the functions. Like so: \r\n\r\n    import argparse\r\n    flag1=True\r\n    flag2=True\r\n    flag3=True\r\n    \r\n    def fun1():\r\n    \t...\r\n    \tif flag1:\r\n    \t\t..something..\r\n    \telse: \r\n    \t\t..something else..\r\n    \t#fun1 also uses the other flags in a similar way\r\n    \t...\r\n    \t\r\n    def fun2():\r\n    \t...\r\n    \tif flag2:\r\n    \t\t..something..\r\n    \telse: \r\n    \t\t..something else..\r\n    \t#fun1 also uses the other flags in a similar way\r\n    \t...\r\n    \r\n    def main()\r\n    \t...\r\n    \targs=parser.parse_args()\r\n    \t...\r\n    \tglobal flag1\r\n    \tflag1=args.flag1\r\n    \t# and so on for the other flags\t\r\n        fun1()\r\n        fun2()\r\n\r\nI have been lead to believe that it is bad practice to use global variables in python from many of the answers here ([this][1], for example). Does that apply here too? I am a little reluctant to pass the flags as arguments since I'll be passing too many variables as arguments. \r\n\r\n**What is the best way to handle flags set by command line arguments?** \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil\n\n## Solution\nThe simplest solution would be to either pass all flags to all your functions (as a single `args` object) or pass relevant flags only depending on which function uses which flag. \r\n\r\nNow this can indeed become quite of a burden, specially with nested function calls where you quickly end up having to pass the whole flags from function to function to function... The cure here is to use a class so you can share state between methods:\r\n\r\n    class Command(object):\r\n        def __init__(self, flags):\r\n            self.flags = flags\r\n    \r\n        def fun1(self):\r\n            ...\r\n            if self.flags.flag1:\r\n                ..something..\r\n            else: \r\n                ..something else..\r\n    \r\n        def fun2(self):\r\n            ...\r\n            if self.flags.flag2:\r\n                ..something..\r\n            else: \r\n                ..something else..\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        def run(self):\r\n            self.fun1()\r\n            self.fun2()     \r\n    \r\n    def main()\r\n        ...\r\n        args=parser.parse_args()\r\n        cmd = Command(args)\r\n        cmd.run()",

      "content": "The following are the top question that matched the query, along with their accepted answers. \n\n# Question 1\n\n## Problem Statement\nSo I'm working my way through Wentworth et al [_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](https://carrot.whitman.edu/Thinkcspy/) a Python 3 guidebook to try and teach myself more about programming. While it's a fantastic resource, it has very little to say about style and \"best practice\" for writing in Python 3. \r\n\r\nI'm working through one of practice questions in the chapter on conditionals that asks me to write a function that returns a string 'grade' when an int or float 'mark' is inputted. \r\n\r\nMy direct question here is about the repetition in the conditionals in the function and the value the function returns. Is it possible to use a loop instead somehow to make it more concise instead of just writing `elif` statements over and over? Also, the main `grade` function is returning a null `None` value; How I can make this function \"fruitful\" and not print `None` when it's called? \r\n\r\nHere's what I've written:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n    \tgrds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n    \t\r\n    \tif mark >= 75.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[0])\r\n    \telif mark < 75.0 and mark >= 70.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[1])\r\n    \telif mark < 70.0 and mark >= 60.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[2])\r\n    \telif mark < 60.0 and mark >= 50.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[3])\r\n    \telif mark < 50.0 and mark >= 45.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[4])\r\n    \telif mark < 45.0 and mark >= 40.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[5])\r\n    \telif mark < 40.0: \r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[6])\r\n\r\n    def finalmark():\r\n\t    mark = float(input(\"Enter your mark\"))\r\n\t    fnlmark = grade(mark)\r\n\t    return fnlmark\r\n\r\n    print(finalmark())    \r\n\n\n## Solution\nRather than using `print()` in the `grade()` function, *return* your result and have the caller print the resulting mark. The `grade()` function should only be used to return a grade:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n\r\n        if mark >= 75.0:\r\n            return grds[0]\r\n        # .. etc\r\n    \r\n    def finalmark():\r\n        mark = float(input(\"Enter your mark\"))\r\n        fnlmark = grade(mark)\r\n        print(\"Your grade is\", fnlmark)\r\n    \r\n    finalmark()\r\n\r\nNote that `finalmark()` is responsible for printing now; that's the best place for it, as that same function also is responsible for printing the question on the screen and taking user input. Like your version, `finalmark()` returns `None` (because that's the default), and I removed the `print()` from around the `finalmark()` call to avoid printing that return value. There's no point in printing it, `finalmark()` will never return anything other than `None`.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also remove half of your tests; only the *first matching* `if` or `elif` branch is picked, the rest are skipped. So you can remove tests for what a previous branch already covered:\r\n    \r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n    \r\n        if mark >= 75.0:\r\n            return grds[0]\r\n        elif mark >= 70.0:\r\n            return grds[1]\r\n        elif mark >= 60.0:\r\n            return grds[2]\r\n        elif mark >= 50.0:\r\n            return grds[3]\r\n        elif mark >= 45.0:\r\n            return grds[4]\r\n        elif mark >= 40.0:\r\n            return grds[5]\r\n        else:\r\n            return grds[6]\r\n\r\nIf the first `if mark >= 75.0:` test did not match, then there is no need to test for `mark < 75.0` anymore, because *we have tested for the inverse*. Testing for `mark >= 70.0` is enough for the next grade. If that fails to match, we know the mark is definitely smaller than 70, so the next test only needs to test if it is larger than `60.0`, etc.\r\n\r\nNow a pattern emerges that you could build a loop on. You test for a *lower bound*, and if it matches, you know which index to return. Build a separate list to store the lower bounds:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n        bounds = [75.0, 70.0, 60.0, 50.0, 45.0, 40.0]\r\n\r\n        for grade, bound in zip(grds, bounds):\r\n            if mark >= bound:\r\n                return grade\r\n\r\n        # there is no lower bound for F3; if the loop didn't find a match,\r\n        # we end up here and can assume the lowest grade.\r\n        return grds[6]\r\n\r\nI used the [`zip()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) here to pair up the grade names and the bounds, pairwise. You could also have used the [`enumerate()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) to generate an index along with each grade name, or a `for index in range(len(grds)):` loop, but I find `zip()` to work cleaner here.\r\n\r\nNext, we can start being clever with the algorithm. The above still tests *each grade, from high to low, one by one*. That can take up to N steps, for N grades. That's a *linear algorithm*, it takes as many steps as there are inputs.\r\n\r\nBut the grades are *sorted*, so we could use bisection here; jump to the middle and see if the mark is lower or higher than the current bound. Then pick either half, and test again, until you find a best match. Bisection takes at most Log(N) steps. Python has a [very fast implementation included](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html); it assumes values in *increasing* order, so reverse the grades and boundaries:\r\n\r\n    import bisect\r\n    \r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['F3', 'F2', 'F1 Supp.', 'Third', 'Second', 'Upper Second', 'First']\r\n        bounds = [40.0, 45.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 75.0]\r\n        return grds[bisect.bisect_right(bounds, mark)]    \r\n\r\n`bisect.bisect_right()` bisects into `bounds` to find the 'insertion point' for `mark`, which will be *to the right* of the same value in the list. So `35.0` would be inserted at `0`, `50.0` at `3` (as it is equal *or higher*), `74.0` at `5` and anything at `75.0` or higher at `6`. And those happen to be the exact indices for the matching grades.",

      "content": "The following are the top question that matched the query, along with their accepted answers. \n\n# Question 1\n\n## Problem Statement\nSo I'm working my way through Wentworth et al [_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](https://carrot.whitman.edu/Thinkcspy/) a Python 3 guidebook to try and teach myself more about programming. While it's a fantastic resource, it has very little to say about style and \"best practice\" for writing in Python 3. \r\n\r\nI'm working through one of practice questions in the chapter on conditionals that asks me to write a function that returns a string 'grade' when an int or float 'mark' is inputted. \r\n\r\nMy direct question here is about the repetition in the conditionals in the function and the value the function returns. Is it possible to use a loop instead somehow to make it more concise instead of just writing `elif` statements over and over? Also, the main `grade` function is returning a null `None` value; How I can make this function \"fruitful\" and not print `None` when it's called? \r\n\r\nHere's what I've written:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n    \tgrds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n    \t\r\n    \tif mark >= 75.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[0])\r\n    \telif mark < 75.0 and mark >= 70.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[1])\r\n    \telif mark < 70.0 and mark >= 60.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[2])\r\n    \telif mark < 60.0 and mark >= 50.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[3])\r\n    \telif mark < 50.0 and mark >= 45.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[4])\r\n    \telif mark < 45.0 and mark >= 40.0:\r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[5])\r\n    \telif mark < 40.0: \r\n    \t\tprint(\"Your grade is\",grds[6])\r\n\r\n    def finalmark():\r\n\t    mark = float(input(\"Enter your mark\"))\r\n\t    fnlmark = grade(mark)\r\n\t    return fnlmark\r\n\r\n    print(finalmark())    \r\n\n\n## Solution\nRather than using `print()` in the `grade()` function, *return* your result and have the caller print the resulting mark. The `grade()` function should only be used to return a grade:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n\r\n        if mark >= 75.0:\r\n            return grds[0]\r\n        # .. etc\r\n    \r\n    def finalmark():\r\n        mark = float(input(\"Enter your mark\"))\r\n        fnlmark = grade(mark)\r\n        print(\"Your grade is\", fnlmark)\r\n    \r\n    finalmark()\r\n\r\nNote that `finalmark()` is responsible for printing now; that's the best place for it, as that same function also is responsible for printing the question on the screen and taking user input. Like your version, `finalmark()` returns `None` (because that's the default), and I removed the `print()` from around the `finalmark()` call to avoid printing that return value. There's no point in printing it, `finalmark()` will never return anything other than `None`.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also remove half of your tests; only the *first matching* `if` or `elif` branch is picked, the rest are skipped. So you can remove tests for what a previous branch already covered:\r\n    \r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n    \r\n        if mark >= 75.0:\r\n            return grds[0]\r\n        elif mark >= 70.0:\r\n            return grds[1]\r\n        elif mark >= 60.0:\r\n            return grds[2]\r\n        elif mark >= 50.0:\r\n            return grds[3]\r\n        elif mark >= 45.0:\r\n            return grds[4]\r\n        elif mark >= 40.0:\r\n            return grds[5]\r\n        else:\r\n            return grds[6]\r\n\r\nIf the first `if mark >= 75.0:` test did not match, then there is no need to test for `mark < 75.0` anymore, because *we have tested for the inverse*. Testing for `mark >= 70.0` is enough for the next grade. If that fails to match, we know the mark is definitely smaller than 70, so the next test only needs to test if it is larger than `60.0`, etc.\r\n\r\nNow a pattern emerges that you could build a loop on. You test for a *lower bound*, and if it matches, you know which index to return. Build a separate list to store the lower bounds:\r\n\r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['First','Upper Second','Second','Third','F1 Supp.','F2','F3']\r\n        bounds = [75.0, 70.0, 60.0, 50.0, 45.0, 40.0]\r\n\r\n        for grade, bound in zip(grds, bounds):\r\n            if mark >= bound:\r\n                return grade\r\n\r\n        # there is no lower bound for F3; if the loop didn't find a match,\r\n        # we end up here and can assume the lowest grade.\r\n        return grds[6]\r\n\r\nI used the [`zip()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) here to pair up the grade names and the bounds, pairwise. You could also have used the [`enumerate()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) to generate an index along with each grade name, or a `for index in range(len(grds)):` loop, but I find `zip()` to work cleaner here.\r\n\r\nNext, we can start being clever with the algorithm. The above still tests *each grade, from high to low, one by one*. That can take up to N steps, for N grades. That's a *linear algorithm*, it takes as many steps as there are inputs.\r\n\r\nBut the grades are *sorted*, so we could use bisection here; jump to the middle and see if the mark is lower or higher than the current bound. Then pick either half, and test again, until you find a best match. Bisection takes at most Log(N) steps. Python has a [very fast implementation included](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html); it assumes values in *increasing* order, so reverse the grades and boundaries:\r\n\r\n    import bisect\r\n    \r\n    def grade(mark):\r\n        grds = ['F3', 'F2', 'F1 Supp.', 'Third', 'Second', 'Upper Second', 'First']\r\n        bounds = [40.0, 45.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 75.0]\r\n        return grds[bisect.bisect_right(bounds, mark)]    \r\n\r\n`bisect.bisect_right()` bisects into `bounds` to find the 'insertion point' for `mark`, which will be *to the right* of the same value in the list. So `35.0` would be inserted at `0`, `50.0` at `3` (as it is equal *or higher*), `74.0` at `5` and anything at `75.0` or higher at `6`. And those happen to be the exact indices for the matching grades.",
