# Project Statement

Software Vulnerability Detection using LLMs --- We will design an LLM-powered
agent for detecting a certain class of vulnerabilities in a certain class of
programs using certain static analysis tools.

# Method

Include one experiment. The one experiment could be similar to what the hacker
role does. The goal is to learn something from the experiment.

  - Choose a class of vulnerabilities
  - Choose a benchmark
  - Choose an existing static analyzer that is somewhat relevant to the class of vulnerabilities
  - Build an LLM-powered agent that detects the chosen class of vulnerabilities while being able to use the static analyzer to assist it
  - Run the agent on the benchmark to see how well it does
